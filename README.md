## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea

### ðŸ“Œ **1. Emotion & Sentiment Analysis**  
- Uses **facial expressions and voice tone** to assess confidence, stress, and engagement.  
- Detects **nervousness, hesitation, enthusiasm, and assertiveness** to evaluate communication skills.  
- Helps interviewers make better decisions by adding **behavioral insights** to technical evaluation.  

### ðŸ“Œ **2. Adaptive Difficulty Scaling**  
- AI **adjusts question difficulty in real time** based on the candidateâ€™s performance.  
- Strong candidates get **harder questions** to test deeper knowledge.  
- Struggling candidates get **moderate-level questions** to fairly assess their understanding.  

### ðŸ“Œ **3. AI-Powered Question Generation**  
- Uses **Machine Learning (ML) & Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to create **custom interview questions**.  
- Starts with **easy, ice-breaking questions**, then moves to **technical and managerial** problem-solving.  
- Ensures a **structured and unbiased** interview process with minimal human intervention.  

### ðŸ“Œ **4. Candidate Scoring & Report Generation**  
- AI scores candidates based on:  
  - **Technical knowledge & problem-solving skills**  
  - **Soft skills & communication (using sentiment analysis)**  
  - **Ability to handle different difficulty levels**  
- Generates **detailed reports** with scores and hiring recommendations for recruiters.
